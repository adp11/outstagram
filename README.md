<!-- Motivation -->
## Motivation
I spent half of my summer 2022 building this Instagram clone. My goals back then?
1. Replicate the web interface of Instagram, just using vanilla CSS. Since then, Instagram has updated its interface.
2. Build an API to support as many core features of Instagram as possible (listed below)
