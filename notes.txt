                                        NOTES ABOUT THIS APP:
stimulate real app flow with more users (5+)
could've reused functions across components and states (notice parent-children passing and the hiearchy)
could've added more realtime listening for remote db (e.g. userData, allUserData, and some more), depended less on client data 
could've added limit, orderBy but please notice a) detachments/memory leaks and b) potential realtime listening bug (e.g. when adding) (because only a set number of items inside the collection is being listened, but not the entire collection)
could've made styling rules more organized and systematic

code clean while building (don't EVER save for later)
avoid long breaks (10+ days) at all costs
